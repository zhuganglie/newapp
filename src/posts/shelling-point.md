### Introduction

- **Hook**: Brief mention of recent protests in China (e.g., COVID-19 lockdown protests) as examples of collective action in a repressive environment.
- **Thesis Statement**: Shelling points, or focal points where individuals coordinate without direct communication, play a critical role in enabling protest movements in repressive societies like China by leveraging implicit social understanding, pre-existing symbols, and strategic public spaces.
- **Purpose of the Essay**: To explore how these focal points contribute to organizing protests and maintaining resilience under tight governmental control.

### Explanation of Shelling Points

- **Definition**: Introduce the concept of Shelling points as developed by Thomas Schelling—a focal point that people use to make decisions in coordination games without prior communication.
- **Relevance to Social Movements**: Explain why Shelling points are particularly valuable in environments where open communication is restricted or monitored.
- **Examples from Non-Repressive Environments**: Brief mention of how Shelling points operate in freer societies (e.g., meeting in a town square or common knowledge events).
