### Introduction

The recent protests against stringent COVID-19 lockdowns across China served as a stark reminder of the enduring human capacity for collective action, even under conditions of pervasive state surveillance and control.  These acts of defiance highlight the crucial role of "Shelling points," or focal points for coordination without direct communication, in enabling protest movements within repressive societies.  This essay will explore how Shelling points, leveraging implicit social understandings, pre-existing symbols, and strategic public spaces, empower individuals to organize and sustain resistance in environments like China where overt dissent is often swiftly and harshly suppressed.
