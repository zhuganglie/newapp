            Hi there! I am just a middle-aged guy who still believes he has got a few good years left in him. By day, I am an educator, the kind that never really stopped being a student. I have spent a lifetime reading social sciences, which has given me just enough knowledge to be dangerous at dinner parties. When I am not trying to figure out how the world works, you can find me pedaling around on my bike, pretending I am training for the Tour de France (spoiler: I am not).
          </p>

          <p>
            I am also a grassroots leader in my local community, which mostly means I am good at nodding and saying, "That is a great idea!" to anyone who has one. My hobbies? Let us see, I am hooked on the game of Go, which I still can not seem to win against the computer, but hey, it is the thought that counts, right? I dabble in coding too—nothing fancy, just enough to make my laptop think I am smarter than I actually am.
          </p>

          <p>
            When it comes to cooking, I like to believe I am a culinary genius, but the smoke detector would probably disagree. At the end of the day, I am just a simple, stupid person trying to keep things pleasant and optimistic, even if that means persevering through a few burnt meals and bad code. Life is a journey, and I am just here for the ride—preferably on two wheels.
