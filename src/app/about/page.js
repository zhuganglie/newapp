      <h1>关于我</h1>
      <hr></hr>
   <p>Hi there! I'm just a middle-aged guy who still believes he's got a few good years left in him. By day, I am an educator, the kind that never really stopped being a student. I have spent a lifetime reading social sciences, which has given me just enough knowledge to be dangerous at dinner parties. When I'm not trying to figure out how the world works, you can find me pedaling around on my bike, pretending I'm training for the Tour de France (spoiler: I am not). </p>   
<p>I'm also a grassroots leader in my local community, which mostly means I am good at nodding and saying, “That is a great idea!” to anyone who has one. My hobbies? Let us see, I am hooked on the game of Go, which I still can not seem to win against the computer, but hey, it is the thought that counts, right? I dabble in coding too—nothing fancy, just enough to make my laptop think I'm smarter than I actually am. </p>

<p>When it comes to cooking, I like to believe I am a culinary genius, but the smoke detector would probably disagree. At the end of the day, I'm just a simple, stupid person trying to keep things pleasant and optimistic, even if that means persevering through a few burnt meals and bad code. Life is a journey, and I am just here for the ride—preferably on two wheels.</p>
