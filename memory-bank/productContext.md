# Product Context

## 1. Problem Solved

This project aims to bridge the gap between academic political science and the general public, making complex topics accessible and understandable. It addresses the potential lack of easily digestible, reliable information on political science concepts for a non-specialist audience.

## 2. How It Should Work

The website/application should present political science knowledge in an engaging and clear manner. Navigation should be intuitive, allowing users to easily find topics of interest. The breadcrumbs component, specifically, helps users understand their location within the site's structure.

## 3. User Experience Goals

- **Accessibility:** Content and navigation should be easy for the general public to understand and use.
- **Engagement:** The presentation should capture user interest.
- **Clarity:** Information architecture and navigation cues (like breadcrumbs) must be clear.
- **Consistency:** A consistent design and user experience across the site is crucial (as noted in the project brief).
