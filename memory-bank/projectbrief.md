# Project Brief

## 1. Main Goal

The primary purpose of this project is to create a website or application dedicated to spreading knowledge of political science to the general public.

## 2. Target Audience

The intended audience is the general public, implying the content and design should be accessible and engaging for individuals without a specialized background in political science.

## 3. Design Requirements

The design should be consistent throughout the application. This suggests a need for a coherent visual style, layout patterns, and component behavior across all pages and features. Further details on specific styles (e.g., color palette, typography, spacing) should be defined in `techContext.md` or a dedicated style guide if available.
