# Progress

## 1. What Works

- The basic structure of the Next.js application is in place.
- The `Breadcrumbs.js` component exists and renders path segments based on the current URL.
- Core Memory Bank documentation structure is established.

## 2. What's Left to Build / Improve

- **Breadcrumbs Styling:** The primary focus is improving the visual design and layout of the `Breadcrumbs.js` component for better consistency, accessibility, and user experience.
- **Overall Site Styling:** Define and implement a consistent design language across the entire application.
- **Content Implementation:** Add the actual political science content.
- **Feature Development:** Implement other necessary features for the site (e.g., search, navigation menus, content pages).

## 3. Current Status

- **Setup Phase:** Initial project setup and foundational documentation are complete.
- **Next Task:** Refine the `Breadcrumbs.js` component styling.

## 4. Known Issues

- The current breadcrumb styling needs improvement for consistency and visual appeal.
- The overall design system/style guide is not yet defined.
- Truncation of long breadcrumb segments might not be optimal (`max-w-[200px]`).
