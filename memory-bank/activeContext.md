# Active Context

## 1. Current Work Focus

The immediate task is to improve the styling and layout of the `src/app/components/Breadcrumbs.js` component. This involves refining its visual appearance and interaction based on the project's goal of consistency and accessibility for the general public.

## 2. Recent Changes

- Initialized the Memory Bank by creating the core documentation files:
    - `projectbrief.md`
    - `productContext.md`
    - `systemPatterns.md`
    - `techContext.md`
    - `activeContext.md` (this file)
    - `progress.md`

## 3. Next Steps

1.  **Analyze `Breadcrumbs.js`:** Review the existing code and identify specific areas for styling and layout improvements.
2.  **Propose Changes:** Suggest concrete modifications to the Tailwind CSS classes and potentially the component structure to enhance appearance and usability.
3.  **Implement Changes:** Apply the agreed-upon changes to `Breadcrumbs.js`.
4.  **Update Documentation:** Reflect the changes made in `progress.md` and potentially other Memory Bank files if patterns emerge.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- **Consistency:** Changes must align with the overall (yet to be fully defined) consistent design language of the site.
- **Accessibility:** Improvements should consider users with disabilities (e.g., clear focus states, sufficient contrast, ARIA attributes).
- **Responsiveness:** The breadcrumbs should adapt gracefully to different screen sizes.
- **Truncation:** The current fixed `max-w-[200px]` might need adjustment for better handling of long segment names.
